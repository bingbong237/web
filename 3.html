  <h2>accessory</h2>
 A basic that is making its comeback stronger than ever is the scarf. In the hair, on the bag, around the neck, the possibilities are endless. Either with a pattern, a monogram, a color, or a basic one, itâ€™s an accessory that will instantly upgrade your outfit. Seen on Camille Charriere with her Dior one, she showed how to style her scarf in different ways. The inspirations are infinite, and you have a multitude of choices from vintage to new luxury pieces.
