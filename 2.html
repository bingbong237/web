  Turn your white oversized shirt into a cute dress
  Take any white oversized shirt and turn it into a dress. Give it a new neckline by cutting the collars in a U-shape. Cut its sleeves according to your preference. Add a belt to the waistline to give the dress some shape.

  Make a shrug out of a loose t-shirt
  Pick any big loose t-shirt from your wardrobe and place in on a flat surface. Cut it from the midsection in a straight line and separate the two sides. Add some fringes to the hemline or add a belt to it. You can also change its neckline by simply cutting it into a different shape.



  Make denim shorts from pants
  Wear the denim pants and check how long you want the shorts to be in terms of length. Then mark straight lines on the denim pants and cut them with a pair of scissors. Now, take a tweezer to tease the bottom part and add fringes at the hemline.

  Mix and match your old suits
  Take kurta of an old suit and lowers from another suit. Pair it with a nice duppatta. And, voila! A new suit for Holi is here!
